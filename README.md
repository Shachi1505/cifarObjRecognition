# CIFAR Object Recognition Project
## Deep Learning Project

The CIFAR-10 dataset, created by the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research, is a widely utilized collection of images in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 distinct classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks, with 6,000 images in each class. This dataset serves as a standard benchmark for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly for object recognition tasks. Due to the low resolution of the images, researchers can efficiently test various algorithms and approaches, making CIFAR-10 a valuable resource in the development of computer vision techniques
